Cascaded Voice Models Pricing Comparison Tool
=====================================================

Project Overview:
This project showcases the pricing differences between various combinations of voice AI models in a cascaded architecture where Speech-to-Text, LLM, and Text-to-Speech are separate components.

Architecture Components:
1. Speech-to-Text (STT): Deepgram Nova-3 (fixed)
2. Large Language Model (LLM): OpenAI (fixed)
3. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Switchable between:
   - Cartesia
   - ElevenLabs
   - Deepgram

Features:
- Interactive web interface with three model slots
- Real-time pricing calculations based on selected models
- Easy switching between TTS providers to compare costs
- Customizable pricing parameters for different use cases
- Visual comparison of total costs for cascaded voice workflows

Target Use Case:
Developers and businesses can use this tool to evaluate the cost implications of different TTS providers while keeping STT and LLM components constant, helping them make informed decisions about their voice AI stack.

Implementation Notes:
- Models don't need to be functionally integrated
- Focus is on pricing visualization and comparison
- User can adjust pricing parameters to match their specific usage patterns
- Clean, modern UI for easy comparison and decision making
